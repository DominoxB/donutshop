    "Why our donuts are so delicious? Their secret lies in the invariably unique taste, which was created from a combination of passion and tradition. Our confectionery was established in 1992, when the idea of ​​creating Donutino was born. All thanks to Donata Pączkowska. Her knowledge and experience made that he was, together with his partner - Jan Cukrowski, the originator of the first confectionery in Pączków. Confectioneries use the original recipe for donut production. We look after it like a precious treasure, taking care of every stage of preparation of our sweets, in accordance with proven and established production methods. Fresh, tasty. hand-made on site - we fry thousands of our best-value specialties every day Donutino donuts are distinguished by something more than fluffy, delicate dough, perfect shape, bright wedding ring and richly stuffed interior. We are proud that we can give you our treasure - unique the taste hidden in our donuts! ",
